            <p>Michael Gary Scott was born <b>March 15, 1965, in Scranton, Pennsylvania</b>. He came from a relatively difficult childhood of loneliness. Michael had some trouble with his early education, shown in "Dunder Mifflin Infinity" as Michael tells the camera crew he was held back from second-grade. In "Diversity Day", Michael claims to be of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. He also claims to be <b>"two-fifteenths" Native American</b>. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff, whom he despises. In "Nepotism", it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister, from whom he was estranged for 15 years. As a consequence of their reunion, Michael hires his nephew Luke as an intern for the office, but eventually confronts the incompetent and rude Luke and ends up <b>spanking him in front of the office</b>, leading Luke to burst into tears and quit.</p>

            <p>"I became a salesman because of people. I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager at a very young age. And I still try to be a friend first. But, you know... when you're very successful, your co-workers look at you differently."</p>
